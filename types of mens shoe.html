        <h2> What is shoe </h2>
            <p> A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot. 
                Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion. 
                The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture,
                with form originally being tied to function. There are saveen types of   Men's shoes</p>

             <h3><p><b>Types of Shoes</b></p> </h3>

                    <p align="left"> 1 Oxford</p>
                </h2>
                    <img src="oxford.jpg" height="150" width="200" border="2" align="left" hspace="10"  > 
                    <p>Kicking off our men’s shoe guide is the mighty Oxford <i> <b>(  or a Balmoral for our UK blokes)</i></b>, 
                        probably the best-known type of dress shoe.</p> 

                    <p> <strong> The Oxford is a sleek</strong>, formal lace-up shoe identified by it’s <b>“closed”</b> lacing style
                         and the appeal that the shoe is made from one piece of leather.</p> 

                    <p>The closed style means that the eyelet flaps on top of <em><strong>the shoe are stitched over the vamp,
                         or the front section of the shoe,</strong></em> restricting the flap’s movement.</p> 
                    <p>Oxfords are usually worn in more formal 
                         situations, but can also be worn casually with a business suit. You might hear someone call this 
                         shoe a <b>“closed front”</b>, but it’s okay, you know they mean Oxford.</p><br><hr>

                 <h2>
                     <p align="left">2 Derby</p>
                 </h2> 
                 <img src="shoes/16513885_350_A derby.jpg" height="150" width="200" border="2" align="left" hspace="10" >

                 <p> <pre><strong>Often confused with the Oxford</strong></pre> the <b>Derby</b> is a close shoe relative, but not the same type of men’s shoe.</p>
                <p>Rather than having a closed lacing system like the Oxford,the Derby sports an open lacing system with the 
                    flaps being <em><b>sewn under the vamp and not connected at front of the shoe.</b></em> </p>

                  <p>This style of stitching makes the flaps capable of movement and when laced the shoe looks as if it’s broken up 
                      into segments <em><b>(top, side, back, etc.)</b></em> Originally a sporting shoe, the Derby was used in more relaxed 
                      environments like hunting.</p>  
                      
                    <p> Although a Derby could be worn in formal settings, it is more casual than an Oxford and could arguably
                         make for a more comfortable, functional fit.</p><br><hr>

                <P>In the <b>U.S., Derby’s and Bluchers</b> are often used interchangeably to describe the open front lace style.</p>
                 <P>But they’re actually two slightly different types of men’s shoes.</p>
                <p>If you pay close enough attention, you’ll see that <strong>Derby’s have the 
                    two sides sewn under the vamp</strong>, whereas <strong>Bluchers connect the two sides onto the vamp.</strong> similar, but it isn’t quite 
                    tomato/tomato.
                <p>The blucher is named after the<em><b>18th century Prussian </em>field marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher</b>. General von Blücher commissioned 
                    a boot with side pieces lapped over the front in an effort to provide his troops with improved footwear. 
                    This design was adopted by armies across Europe</p><br><hr>

                <p>Ahh, the Chelsea Boot. The <b>favourited boot style</b> of rock icons.</p> 
                <p>The Beatles and badass galaxy soldiers in <em>George Lucas</em>’ original Star Wars trilogy (yup, stormtroopers have a thing for Chelsea Boots).</p>
                <p>That easily makes it one of our favourites types of dress shoes as well</p>
                <p>Originated during the Victorian era, but made mainstream cool in the 60s, this snug 
                    style of ankle boot is classified by its low heel,fabric tab on its’ backside and 
                    slip-on/slip off quality thanks to its elastic side panelling.
                 Chelsea Boots have rounded toes and are versatile enough to be worn with <strong>jeans or a suit.</strong></p><br><hr>

                <P>Identified by its <b>wide heel and slip-on capabilities,</b> 
                    the <em>Loafer was inspired by mocassins;</em> the shoe of choice for Native Americans.</P>
                    <p>Like Oxfords, Moccasins come in a variety of lace-less styles (<b>tassel, penny loafer, monk strap, etc.</b>). </p>
                    <p>Regardless of style, when it comes to the various types of men’s shoes, 
                        <pre><strong>Loafers are generally considered to be the most casual.</strong>   </pre> </p>
                        <p>You can throw on a pair of loafers for a night on the dance floor with jeans or pair it with a suit.</p>
                            <p>But we wouldn’t recommend loafers to wear anywhere fancy.</p><br><hr>

                            <p>Brogue shoes are a style of Oxford, Blucher or 
                                Loafer that come with a perforated design punched along the edge of the leather overlapping the vamp</p>
                                <p>In short, Brogue is the style of shoes with the holes and thereby it’s own type of men’s dress shoe</p>
                                <p>But there are also types of Brogues and that’s worth distinguishing further.</p>
                                <p>Hence we’re about to go all types of dress shoes within types of dress shoes on you,

                <p><b>Chukkas are a Derby styled ankle boot. </b></p>   
                <p>Typically made from calfskin or suede, chukkas are created by using two to three sets of 
                    eyelets and an open lacing system to secure the quarters over the tongue of the boot.</p>  
                    <p>Chukkas are usually made from calfskin or suede,although they can be made from other materials</p> 
                    <p>The style first became popular in the late <b>1940s through the 1960s</b> as casual wear.</p>
                    <p>In the <em><strong>21st century</strong></em>, chukkas persist as a popular menswear shoe, particularly in the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>
                    They can be worn with both suits and more casual wear like jeans.</p>
                    <p>According to shoe <em><strong>historian June Swann</strong></em>, the essential chukka boot is <strong>ankle-high, 
                        open-laced, and unlined</strong>, with two to three pairs of eyelets, thin leather soles,
                         calfskin suede uppers in two parts (each from a single piece of leather; quarters sewn
                          on top of vamp), and rounded toes.<br><hr></p>
